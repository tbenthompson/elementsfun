perfectly matched layer == for use when need to absorb waves propagating towards a boundary in a finite computational domain
spectral-element-method == just like a normal FEM method, but with a somewhat complex element computation technique using gauss-lobatto-legendre points as the computation points for quadrature
then, on top of this, we can implement some sort of simple transformation to represent each element so that they can be curved hexahedra in 3d, or non-unit line,square,cube in general
